            <p>Social housing tenants may encounter difficulties in preparing for and responding to flooding due to
                their living arrangements and because they are likely to have a low income.</p>
            <p>Tenants are often not allowed to make physical alterations to their properties, and leaseholders may be
                disinclined to as they may not feel the additional expense of making those changes is worthwhile given
                that they do not own the freehold. Landlords of social housing may be more inclined to make these
                alterations, but little quantified evidence exists.</p>
            <p>Where tenants are permitted to make physical alterations to their dwellings, there is little incentive to
                do so. This may be because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tenancies are often short, with limited security of tenure so these residents are likely to be less
                    aware of the flood risk in their neighbourhoods;
                </li>
                <li>Tenants are generally less well-off than homeowners (The Poverty Site, 2014), and therefore cannot
                    afford to install meaningful physical risk reducing measures.
                </li>
                <li>Tenants are less likely than homeowners to speak English as their first language and so may not be
                    easily able to access information on flood risk and preparedness.
