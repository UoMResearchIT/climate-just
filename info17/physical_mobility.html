                <li>Someone with a disability will require a higher amount of resources and planning for them to reach the same level of wellbeing as someone without that disability and this should be reflected in disaster management and evacuation plans (Cabinet Office, 2013).</li>
                <li>People with reduced mobility may be more reliant on others to assist them for example during evacuation either from their own homes or from serviced accommodation such as care homes. Disruption caused by a flood may prevent carers reaching those they care for and may leave assistance tools such as electronic lifts unusable.</li>
                <li>Where individuals are normally able to help themselves, any loss of power or internal flooding may severely reduce their capacity to do so.</li>
