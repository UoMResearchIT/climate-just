        <td valign="top" width="25%"><p> Evidence supporting the use of this supporting variable </p></td>
        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Various studies, including by the National Flood Forum, highlight the link between the degree of support provided by institutional (such as the police, the fire brigade, ambulances and local authority social care) and community support networks and the vulnerability of the individuals in those communities. Higher levels of post-flood institutional support can accelerate the pace of recovery<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Emergency services will aim to target the most vulnerable households in assistance efforts but the ability to do this effectively relies on the flood resilience of these services themselves. During the 2010 flood in Cockermouth, Cumbria, the police station itself was flooded which hampered the coordination of the relief effort and therefore increasingly the vulnerability of the population to the flood (BBC, 2010).</p>
            <p>If a school floods, children are often temporarily transferred to other schools which may be some distance away while the original school is restored. This adds to family disruption and dislocation, increasing their vulnerability<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The location of services that should remain accessible throughout a flood event, such as GP surgeries, is very important, especially as they can be essential in relief plans (Kazmierczak and Kenny, 2011).</p>
            <p>If care or nursing homes are flooded, highly vulnerable residents must be evacuated and suitable placements for them have to be found. If a care home or hospital is in a flood prone area, it is also likely that many of its employees will also live in the flood risk area, or will have to travel through a flooded area. Additionally, care homes will also often take in vulnerable residents who have been evacuated from their own homes. This system is severely hampered if the care home itself is flooded (Donovan, 2014).</p>
