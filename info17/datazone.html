  <h4>Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics</h4>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Data Zones</strong></p>
  <p>The data zone is the key small-area statistical geography in Scotland. SNS has introduced, for the first time, a common, stable and consistent, small-area geography called data zones. The data-zone geography covers the whole of Scotland and nests within local authority boundaries. Data zones are groups of 2001 Census output areas and have populations of between 500 and 1,000 household residents. Where possible, they have been made to respect physical boundaries and natural communities. They have a regular shape and, as far as possible, contain households with similar social characteristics.</p>
