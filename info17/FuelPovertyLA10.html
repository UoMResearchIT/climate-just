  <h4>Fuel Poverty (10% definition)</h4>
  <p>The map shows the percentage of households in each local authority (or lsoa) which are defined as being in fuel poverty, under the 10% definition. Under this definition a fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10% of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth. In England, this is defined as 21°C in the living room and 18°C in other occupied rooms. The data is for 2012, which is the most recent data available at the time of production of the map.
