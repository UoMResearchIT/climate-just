      <td valign="top" width="25%"><p> Guidance for the use of this indicator </p></td>
      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> People who live in areas which have had previous flooding have a higher likelihood to be able to prepare and respond to future flood events. For example, they are more likely to know where to look for information, they are more likely to live in areas with a flood plan and they are more likely to have community and other support in place.  The mapped indicator shows relative proportions of land area affected from low to high. It is therefore important to note that in contrast with most other indicators in the portal where higher values represent higher vulnerability, higher values for this indicator indicate lower vulnerability. There are some sources of uncertainty with this indicator. Firstly, it could be argued that past flooding increases vulnerability, due to factors such as lack of affordable insurance or previous impacts on health and wellbeing which increase people’s sensitivity. Furthermore the land area affected by flooding is not a direct indicator of properties – and people - affected.</p></td>
