        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Those with experience of flooding are less vulnerable in subsequent events as they have more knowledge as to what to do and how to respond.</p>
            <p>Flood experience has often been shown to be a key factor in level of willingness to take preventative action against future floods, and also respond seriously to warnings (Tapsell et al., 2005; McCarthy et al., 2006; Tunstall et al., 2006).</p>
            <p>Fielding et al. (2007) found that there was a higher level of understanding of what the EA flood warning codes meant in households that had previously flooded.</p>
            <p>This idea is characterised by the “prisoner of experience” phenomenon (e.g. Shaw et al., 2005), whereby those without experience are less able to cope, and until people (unfortunately) have direct experience of flooding they are more vulnerable (although it may require homes to flooded several times before people are willing to act).</p></td>
