      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Adaptation needs to address the specific challenges associated with places with a higher proportion of households with no private
          transport. This may restrict peopleâ€™s ability to respond during events like floods and to assist dependents, for example. Furthermore, they
          may be particularly affected during disruptions to public transport services. It is also important to consider how householders with no
          private transport might be supported more generally, perhaps within areas which otherwise have low social vulnerability. For example, this
          may be through community-based solutions, such as help with organizing car sharing and dedicated transport during extreme events.
          Additional, more refined, data may be available at the local level. </p></td>
