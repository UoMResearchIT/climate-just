  <p class="lead"><strong>Flood zones</strong></p>
  <p>Flood zones are divided areas of the natural floodplain, and are shown on our flood map for planning.</p>
  <p>They divide the floodplain into 3 areas or zones that represent different levels of flood risk, not taking into account the presence of flood defences.</p>
  <p>The zones are shown as shaded areas on a map and are used by the local planning authorities when considering planning applications.</p>
  <p class="lead"><strong>What the flood zones mean</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Zone 1</strong> - shows areas with the lowest probability of flooding from rivers and the sea, where the chance of flooding in any one year is less than 0.1% (i.e. a 1000 to 1 chance).</p>
  <p><strong>Zone 2</strong> - shows the area between zone 1 and zone 3. This represents an area with the chance of flooding in any one year between 0.1% and 1% fluvial or 0.5% tidal (i.e. between a 1000 to 1 and a 100 to 1 fluvial or 200 to 1 tidal chance). The outer edge of this zone is referred to as the 'Extreme Flood Outline' (EFO).</p>
  <p><strong>Zone 3</strong> - shows areas with the highest probability of flooding. The chance of flooding in any one year is greater than or equal to 1% (i.e. a 100 to 1 chance) for river flooding and greater or equal to 0.5% (i.e. a 200 to 1 chance) for coastal and tidal flooding.</p>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Risk of flooding from rivers and sea</strong></p>
  <p>River flooding happens when a river cannot cope with the amount of water draining into it from the surrounding land. Sea flooding happens when there are high tides and stormy conditions.</p>
