          of providing care helps to extend social networks and enhance wider ‘social capital’<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> for
          both the carers and those being <a href="https://www.adhc.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0005/236498/11_Care_Network_final_report_Oct_10_for_publication.pdf" target="_blank">cared for</a>.
          In turn, social capital <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/170078/Is-Social-Capital-good-for-your-health.pdf" target="_blank">has been shown</a> to be
          connected to health benefits in both individuals and also wider communities. However, the use of this indicator as a proxy for social
          networks is open to debate. Higher proportions of unpaid caring can be indicative of higher proportions of ill-health in an area.
          Furthermore, <a
                        href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/provision-of-unpaid-care-in-england-and-wales--2011/sty-unpaid-care.html"
                    > there is evidence </a> that unpaid carers themselves tend to have less good health compared to the health of people not providing unpaid care. It could also be
          argued that in some cases unpaid carers might be more isolated than other people as a result of the demands of their caring duties. They
          may face specific challenges when faced with extreme events. The low level of confidence in this particular indicator is also influenced by
          unpaid carers encompassing a very broad group. The indicator does not differentiate types of carers, who they care for and on what basis or
          level of paid care provision. More detailed local datasets may be available to help refine this indicator in the context of particular
          local circumstances. </p></td>
