        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p>People living in areas with higher crime rates may be more wary of taking preventative measures against flooding and have extra security mechanisms on their houses such as multiple locks on doors and windows; this can cause delays in evacuation and rescue attempts.</p>
            <p>People living in areas with higher crime rates may be more wary of taking preventative measures against flooding in case they are 'scams', and so may be more socially vulnerable than communities with lower crime rates.</p>
            <p>Where crime rates are high, residents may hesitate to evacuate properties during floods for fear of looting. For example, during the 2014 floods on the Somerset Levels, it was reported that empty houses were being targeted by thieves taking domestic heating oil (The Independent, 2014).</p></td>
