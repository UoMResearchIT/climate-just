      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Shops and other community-related infrastructure can act as informal refuges during extreme events. People living in areas with lower
          densities of infrastructure which might perform this function are assumed to have higher vulnerability compared to people living in places
          with higher densities. The mapped indicator shows densities from low to high. It is therefore important to note that in contrast with most
          other indicators in the portal where higher values represent higher vulnerability, higher values for this indicator indicate lower
          vulnerability. </p></td>

      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Community resilience can be enhanced in areas where retail and other community infrastructure is available, however informally, as places
          of potential refuge. For example, any air conditioned space can provide an informal refuge during heat-wave events as well as a source of
          wider assistance. For example, an analysis of the 1995 Chicago heat-wave identified cases where people combined visits to the grocery store
          with the opportunity to cool down.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> All other things being equal, adaptive capacity in
          areas with a lower density of community and commercial facilities can be expected to be lower compared to areas where the density is
          higher, even where spaces are not air conditioned. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that other individual and neighbourhood
          characteristics may influence the extent to which people are able to take advantage of these opportunities, e.g. due to restrictions on
          personal mobility or fear of crime. Particular measures may be needed to address the specific challenges associated with places where these
          opportunities are limited. There may be opportunities to formalise arrangements in some areas. For example, heatwave planning in parts of
          Greece involves formalised arrangements with owners of air conditioned spaces which are not fully accessible to the wider public.
          Additional sources of information may also be available at a local level, e.g. lists of public buildings which may be air conditioned or
          which could act as possible cool spaces relative to flats in high-rise buildings, for example. </p></td>
