            vulnerability. They have a lower ability to adapt (to prepare for events and respond to them) because they
            may be less aware that their new community has a flood risk issue and have less knowledge about what to do
            if affected.</p>

            <p>Communities where population turnover is high may be less aware of the likelihood of being affected by
                events like floods, how to respond and where to seek support (Penning-Rowsell et al., 1986).</p>
            <p>People who have recently moved into an area may lack awareness of local flood risk provided through
                family and community clues. Blaikie et al. (1994) states that lack of knowledge and information is one
                of the most important underlying reasons for vulnerability (Werritty et al., 2007).</p>
            <p>People living in rural areas tend to have more knowledge of local flood risk compared to urban areas, not
                least (but not exclusively) because they have longer residence times (Penning-Rowsell et al., 1986).</p>
