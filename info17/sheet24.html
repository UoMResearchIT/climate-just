  <h4>Ability to recover (heat)</h4>
  <p>A person’s or community’s ability to recover from climate and extreme weather events is governed primarily by social factors. With respect to heat this includes factors such as social networks, mobility and the availability of services. The map shows the result of an equally-weighted combination of neighbourhood-level scores for indicators within the domains associated with respect to heat:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information use – language</li>
    <li>Social networks</li>
    <li>Mobility</li>
    <li>Service access</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Neighbourhood mapping uses Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) from the UK Census, 2011. More information is available in the ClimateJust user guide  and list of limitations . This area-based representation provides only a broad, national-scale indication of local patterns and users are strongly encouraged to build on this starting point with finer scale geographical data and other local data holdings.</p>
