 <td width="25%">Guidance for the use of this indicator</td>
 <td width="75%">This indicator accounts for the additional impact that physical location can have during events like heat-waves. All other things being equal, areas at higher elevations are more likely to be cooler compared to lower lying areas. Additional, more refined, data may be available at the local level, e.g. through data agreements with the Ordnance Survey.</td>
