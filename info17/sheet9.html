  <h4>Heat disadvantage (Population weighted vulnerability and mean summer maximum temperature 2050s) Medium Emissions scenario 50th percentile (Recommended)</h4>
  <p>The maps of heat disadvantage show how heat-related social vulnerability combines with the potential for exposure to heat-related events. They account for both the likelihood of coming into contact with high temperatures and also the severity of negative impacts on the health and wellbeing of local communities that could occur as a result of that contact. This map shows the result of an equally-weighted combination of neighbourhood-level scores over a 25km grid for: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>population-weighted socio-spatial heat vulnerability</li>
  <li>heat hazard-exposure according to mean summer maximum temperature in the 2050s (<b>medium emissions scenario, 50th percentile</b>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The maps are shown by 25km grid cell, conforming to climate scenario outputs from UKCP09. <b>These maps for the central (50th percentile) estimate of the medium scenario for mean summer maximum temperature in the 2050s are a recommended starting point. However, users are encouraged to review maps for other probability levels and emissions scenarios in line with UKCP09 guidance.  Maps are provided for three scenarios and three probability levels</b>.  More information is available in the ClimateJust user guide, the main report , UKCP09  and the list of limitations.</p>
  <p>Acknowledgements: See indicator information for relevant data acknowledgements for the inputs to this dataset. UK Climate Projections 2009, Crown copyright.UKCP09 data show 50th, 90th and 10th percentile estimates for each climate metric for the low (L50), medium (M50) and high (H50) emissions scenarios. Population-weighted centre-points of neighbourhoods (MSOAs) areas have been used to allocate neighbourhood-based data to the appropriate 25km grid cell. See the main report for more information.</p>
