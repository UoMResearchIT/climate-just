            vulnerable to the impacts of a flood as the experience can make their pre-existing condition worse either as a one-off 'hit', or due to accelerating
            its adverse trajectory.</p></td>

        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p>More information about people in poor health and social vulnerability, as well as what can be done to help, is available
            in the main site. <a href="http://www.climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-poor-health" target="_blank">http://www.climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-poor-health</a>
        </p>
            <p>Some of the specific evidence for this indicator includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flooding may restrict an individual’s access to medicine, e.g. due to loss or damage or it being left behind in the context of an emergency
                    (Age UK, 2016).
                </li>
                <li>Flooding may prevent the use of complex home-based health care systems, for example home dialysis, due to direct flood damage or to loss of
                    power (Klinger et al., 2014).
                </li>
                <li>Being flooded is stressful and mental health impacts can be serious. Recorded psychological stresses caused by flooding in the UK and OECD
                    (e.g. Tapsell et al., 2002) include: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and domestic violence (Pendlebury and Bates, 2015).
                    A delayed increase in suicide rates has been observed following natural disasters, although the evidence of this after flood events is very
                    limited (Kolves et al., 2013). Many of these psychological effects last much longer (2+ years) than any adverse physical health effects
                    (Tapsell et al., 2002).
                    While post-event stress is likely to affect everyone, those with existing mental health conditions are likely to suffer the most (Sims et
                    al., 2008; Waite et al., 2017).
                </li>
                <li>Telephone connectivity and transport routes are often disrupted during flood events making it difficult for carers to contact and reach
                    their patients that are receiving care at home (Age UK, 2016). This was a problem in Lancashire during the flooding in 2015 caused by Storm
                    Desmond.
