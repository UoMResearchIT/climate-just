      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> This indicator accounts for the additional impact that local environments can have during events like floods and heat-waves. Gardens can
          provide better drainage and a cooling function. Therefore areas where housing tends to have relatively small gardens are more likely to see
          severe impacts compared with areas where housing tends to be associated with relatively large gardens. There is some uncertainty since
          cooling and drainage functions are strongly affected by the way that property owners develop their gardens. Background information relevant
          to this indicator is available in the <a href="http://climatejust.org.uk/messages/adapting-buildings" target="_blank">adapting buildings and green space</a> messages in the main portal,
          including actions which can be taken to respond. Additional, more refined, data may be available at the local level, e.g. through data
          agreements with the Ordnance Survey. </p></td>
