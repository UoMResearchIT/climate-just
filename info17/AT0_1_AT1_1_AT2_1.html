      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Unemployment is a recognised proxy indicator of financial deprivation; indeed, the unemployed are <a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/2041.pdf" target="_blank">nearly twice as likely</a> to experience persistent poverty compared to the
          population as a whole. Adaptation should address the needs of people who have <a href="http://climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-low-incomes" target="_blank">lower incomes</a>. This is because a lack of financial resources may restrict people’s access to some ways of preparing for, responding to and recovering from hazard events. A range of actions appropriate to tackling these difficulties is given in our dedicated pages on this topic. Unemployment is commonly used as a measure of <a href="http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=0&ProjectID=15747#RelatedDocuments" target="_blank">vulnerability</a>. For example, unemployment or irregular employment may reduce the opportunities for obtaining insurance. Unemployment
          is linked to other social characteristics, such as being in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284648/English_Housing_Survey_Headline_Report_2012-13.pdf" target="_blank"> social or privately rented housing </a> and a greater tendency to have <a href="http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review" target="_blank">poor physical and mental health</a>. Although unemployment is taken as an indicator of a tendency towards high vulnerability, it may reduce vulnerability in some cases. For example, unemployed people may benefit from being able to respond quickly to events like floods and heat-waves and potentially getting assistance through social housing. Despite this, people in this group are significantly more likely have negative impacts on their health and wellbeing in the aftermath of flooding<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

          available at the local level. </p></td>
