          potential to have a longer recovery time compared to other areas. The basis for this indicator is the assumption that areas with low or
          falling house prices are more likely to be associated with general decline and where residents themselves may have lower long-term mobility
          and less financial security. The mapped indicator shows positive to negative change. Higher positive values for this indicator indicate
          lower vulnerability in contrast with many of the other indicators in this portal. </p></td>

      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> The impact of flood events on property prices is a common concern in the aftermath of flood events <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Research by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests that house prices are
          affected, but not by as much as householders may initially fear. Property price reductions in the region of around 9-12% have been reported <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>. However, the same evidence does suggest that this may be a temporary phenomenon with a
          considerable recovery of property prices over the subsequent 3-4 year period and few reported examples of a complete collapse of house
          values as a result of flooding<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Nevertheless, this may not fully allay residents’ concerns
          and some of the worry and concern impacting on people’s recovery. For example, there is evidence that residents are concerned about house
          price falls, the possibility of some neighbours moving away regardless and then the changes in community character as a result <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This is a medium confidence proxy indictor which is subject to considerable uncertainty
          and debate. For example, there can be many reasons for relative changes in house prices which have no connection to the chance of flooding
          or how frequently or severely it has already occurred. Even so, declining areas are still relevant to post-flood recovery since they are
          more broadly indicative of declining communities and lower social mobility. Where an area is affected by flooding and the property market
          is already weak or declining then the impacts on residents could be all the greater. The issue raises wider questions about how to tackle
          the issue of declining neighbourhoods in areas associated with potential exposure to extreme events like flooding or coastal erosion. While
          these issues are beyond the remit of Climate Just they may be a topic for wider debate at the local level. Despite some limitations, the
          indicator can be useful as part of the suite of factors which characterise particular places and help explain why the people living there
          may take longer to recover. A stagnant or declining house price market may act as an additional pressure for affected residents. If
          considered applicable to the local area under study, it may be possible to supplement this indicator with additional, finer-scale data. </p></td>
