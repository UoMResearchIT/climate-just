            <p>Some of the specific evidence for this indicator includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of deaths caused by the 1953 ‘Big Flood’ was highest among older people (Baxter, 2005), with people over 60 year olds accounting for 42% of resulting deaths in Essex (Vardoulakis and Heaviside, 2012).</li>
                <li>Older people are less likely than other social groups to respond to flood warnings and may be more reluctant to leave their houses (Age UK, 2016), as well as having more limited physical mobility, making it difficult to use flood defence measures, such as putting up property level flood gates (Vardoulakis and Heaviside, 2012).</li>
                <li>Tapsell et al. (2002) looked in detail at six case studies from across the UK; these showed that those over the age of 75 were more vulnerable to flooding.</li>
