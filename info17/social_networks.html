        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Higher proportions of people in an area who are socially isolated indicate a higher vulnerability. Socially isolated people are more vulnerable to flooding due to being less likely to ask for assistance. They are less likely to benefit from community knowledge, community activities and community responses. Similarly social cohesion may be less strong as a whole.</p></td>

        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> More information about people who are socially isolated and social vulnerability, as well as what can be done to help, is available in the main site. http://www.climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-who-are-socially-isolate</p>
            <p>People with weaker social networks;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Struggle to maintain continuity of treatment in relation to physical or mental health treatments (WHO, 2013). Where social networks are relatively good there is evidence of a better response to emergency situations and quicker recovery (Preston et al., 2014).</li>
                <li>Face practical difficulties in responding to a flood where children are dependent on them as there is less direct within-the-family support (Tapsell et al., 2002).</li>
                <li>Adults who live alone (including those with dependent children) are more likely to struggle to take action when receiving a flood warning, for example it may be physically impossible to move furniture or other items, and they will also feel more uncertain and anxious with no-one to confide in (Thrush et al., 2005).</li>
                <li>Face difficulties in accessing short-term alternative accommodation from family and friends, and so are more likely to need to use public shelters in the event of an evacuation (Scawthorn et al., 2006), but also may be less likely to know about the existence and location of such services.</li>
                <li>Informal networks are much reduced or even absent during a flood (Tapsell et al., 2002; Penning-Rowsell and Tapsell, 2002)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>People with pre-school age children can become socially isolated. However, those with school age children tend to have better local social networks (Corcoran et al., 2010) and in many cases locally-focused charities reduce the social isolation of individuals (Kazmierczak et al, 2015; Leisure Futures, 2011).</p>
            <p>Connections have been made between a lack of social or community networks and other factors which increase social vulnerability. For example, this is also linked to areas with highly transient populations, with residents less likely to have access to family or friends nearby (Zsamboky et al., 2011). Individuals that are more likely to feel socially isolated include single parents, lone pensioners and new arrivals to an area.</p>
