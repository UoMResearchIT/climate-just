  <h4>Sensitivity</h4>
  <p>Sensitivity refers to personal biophysical characteristics which affect the likelihood that a heat wave or flood event will have negative health and welfare impacts. For example, older people tend to be more susceptible to the effects of high temperatures. The map shows the result of an equally-weighted combination of neighbourhood-level scores for indicators within the two domains associated with Sensitivity:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Health</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Neighbourhood mapping uses Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) from the UK Census, 2011. More information is available in the ClimateJust user guide  and list of limitations . This area-based representation provides only a broad, national-scale indication of local patterns and users are strongly encouraged to build on this starting point with finer scale data and local data holdings.</p>
