Therefore this indicator
          is used as a proxy for low incomes. Average levels of wealth for households headed by people working in routine occupations has been
          estimated to be only 14% of those of working in employment classified as ‘large employer or higher managerial’<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Adaptation should address their needs because a lack of financial resources <a href="http://climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-low-incomes" target="_blank">may restrict people’s access</a> to some ways of preparing for, responding
          to and recovering from hazard events. A range of actions appropriate to tackling these difficulties is given in our dedicated pages on this
          topic. People working in routine and semi-routine occupations <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/extras/adaptation.pdf" target="_blank">may also be vulnerable for other reasons</a>, such as higher
          exposure to hazards due to the characteristics of their jobs or increased sensitivity due to being more likely to be in <a href="http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review" target="_blank">ill-health</a>. Some actions might
          be targeted through employers – so-called <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/extras/adaptation.pdf" target="_blank">inward looking adaptation</a> which can be part of a wider drive
          to improve working conditions – or through trades associations, clubs or societies. Measures can include training, provision of appropriate
          equipment and clothing, improving working environments, consideration of accessibility issues (e.g. during extreme weather) and broader
          awareness raising. Additional, more refined, data may be available at the local level. </p></td>
