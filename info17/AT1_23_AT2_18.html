      <td valign="top" width="25%"><p> Guidance for the use of this indicator </p></td>
      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Adaptation needs to address the specific challenges associated with places with a higher proportion of single pensioner households (as is
          measured by this indicator), but more specifically places where communities are likely to have socially isolated individuals with poor
          social networks. However, it is also important to develop actions to target places where there may be fewer single pensioner households but
          where individuals might still be socially or physically isolated, perhaps within areas which otherwise have low social vulnerability.
          Responses in places with high concentrations of single pensioner households may differ from those in places with low concentrations, for
          example, if there are more intermediary organisations or networks such as community organisations who can work with older people with
          particular needs. See the separate message on <a href="http://climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-who-are-socially-isolated" target="_blank">social isolation</a> for more evidence and possible
          responses. Additional, more refined, data on older people, their relative sensitivities and other characteristics which tend to make them
          more or less vulnerable may be available at the local level. </p></td>
