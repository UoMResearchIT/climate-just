      <td valign="top" width="508"><p> Adaptation needs to address the specific challenges associated with places with a higher proportion of lone parents with dependent children
          (as is measured by this indicator), but more specifically places where communities are likely to include socially isolated people who have
          poor social networks. The use of this indicator as a proxy for social networks and the assumption that higher proportions of lone parents
          with dependent children may result in more potential for isolation is open to debate. There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214568/rrep782.pdf" target="_blank">conflicting evidence</a> which
          points to both the potential for stronger networks and also the chance for higher rates of isolation within this group. Although this
          indicator is used as a proxy measure of networks, considering the distributions of lone parents with dependent children may be helpful as
          an indicator of other vulnerability factors since this also points to greater responsibilities which may reduce their capacity for
          responding to extreme events relative to other groups. Other measures of social networks for people with young children may be available
          from internal data sources or from local organisations working with vulnerable people. </p></td>
