      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Unemployment is a recognised indicator of financial deprivation (see Unemployment info). The challenges facing the unemployed are
          heightened in terms of the long-term unemployed. Therefore this indicator is used as a proxy for low incomes. Average levels of wealth for
          households headed by people who are long-term unemployed or who have never worked are just 3% of those of working in employment classified
          as ‘large employer or higher managerial’<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Adaptation should address the needs of people
          who have <a href="http://climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-low-incomes" target="_blank">lower incomes</a>. This is because a lack of financial resources
          may restrict people’s access to some ways of preparing for, responding to and recovering from hazard events. A range of actions appropriate
          to tackling these difficulties is given in our dedicated pages on this topic. Although unemployment is taken as an indicator of a tendency
          towards high vulnerability, it may reduce vulnerability in some cases. For example, unemployed people may benefit from being able to
          respond quickly to events like floods and heat-waves and potentially getting assistance through social housing. Despite this, people in
          this group are significantly more likely have negative impacts on their health and wellbeing in the aftermath of flooding <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Additional, more refined, data may be available at the local level. </p></td>
