      <td valign="top" width="25%"><p> Guidance for the use of this indicator </p></td>
      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> In 2013, Defra launched a consultation on the future of flood insurance in the UK. It explains that “A series of agreements on flood
          insurance have been made between Governments in the UK and the insurance industry since the 1960s. The current “Statement of Principles”
          agreements, which are about to expire, require members of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to make insurance including cover for
          flooding available to some, but not all, properties in areas at significant flood risk. The Statement of Principles <a
                        href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/flooding/floodinsurance/supporting_documents/20130626%20FINAL%20Future%20of%20Flood%20Insurance%20%20consultation%20document.pdf"
                    > does not control or limit </a> the price that insurers can charge for this cover.” This is the basis of the assumption that people who live in areas classified as being
          at significant flood risk are more likely to have difficulty obtaining insurance. The indicator was developed before the announcement of
          “Flood Re”, a new deal struck by the UK government and the ABI, which should be implemented by 2015 and will cap insurance premiums for
          properties located in areas with high flood probability. Though this is an important development it does not mean that insurance will be
          equally affordable to householders in the future, just as it isn’t today. There are also expected to be a number of households excluded
          from access to the Flood Re premiums. Therefore this indicator may still be useful as a broad guide to areas in which affordable insurance
          may be relatively difficult to obtain and, accordingly, a measure of how far people are able to prepare for, respond to and recover from
          events. There are several other sources of uncertainty with this indicator. The land area affected by flooding is not a direct indicator of
          properties – and people - affected. Other factors may also affect whether affordable insurance is available, including the likelihood of
          other forms of flooding. Finally, the specific data used <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nafra-spatial-flood-likelihood-category-grid-afa106" target="_blank">have some uncertainties</a> and are only intended
          to be used as a ‘broad brush’ indication of the chance of flooding. The data portal provides alternative flood zone data. Users should note
          that these data are associated with similar caveats and note appropriate for identifying the chance of flooding at individual properties. </p></td>
