      <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Adaptation needs to address the specific challenges associated with places where people may be reluctant to take preventative measures
          during, or immediately prior to, events like floods and heat-waves. For example, if there is a fear of crime in an area people may feel
          less able to leave windows open at night during heat-wave events. Fear of crime was found to be one of the major factors explaining why
          some people were more negatively affected than others in the 1995 heat-wave in Chicago, for example. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> People may also be less inclined to deploy measures like flood gates since this can
          indicate that the householder is away. This is a proxy indicator which has been given a medium confidence rating. It is uncertain because
          the factor of interest is fear of crime which may not necessarily correspond to the reality of crime rates in an area. It is also
          recognised that there are different types of crime, not all of which will have the same impact on individual and community perceptions.
          Nevertheless, measures which address reasons for people not feeling able to respond to warnings may be an important consideration when
          working towards more resilient communities. Additional and finer scale indicators are available through the Index of Multiple Deprivation
          and crime statistics datasets. Further sources of information may also be available at a local level. </p></td>
