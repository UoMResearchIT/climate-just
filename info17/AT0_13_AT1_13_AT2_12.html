          provided to the general public. However, some within this group may have English as their mother tongue and/or have no difficulties
          understanding the English language. Note that the indicator source was selected to allow a more direct comparison with the equivalent 2001
          indicator. An improved indicator (QS205EW) ‘Proficiency in English’ has been made available for the first time in 2011. </p></td>
