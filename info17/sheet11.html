  <h4>Heat hazard-exposure (Mean summer maximum temperature 2050s)</h4>
  <p>The maps of heat hazard-exposure broadly show where there is likely to be a greater chance of coming into contact with heat-related events. This set of maps shows mean summer maximum temperature in the 2050s. The maps are shown by 25km grid cell, conforming to climate scenario outputs from UKCP09. In line with UKCP09 guidance, maps are provided for three scenarios and three probability levels. The maps for the central (50th percentile) estimate of the medium scenario for mean summer maximum temperature in the 2050s are a recommended starting point. More information is available in the ClimateJust user guide , the main report  and list of limitations . This is an imperfect representation of the likelihood of people and communities coming into contact with heat-waves. Users should also note that people in different parts of the country are already used to different temperatures so heat health warning thresholds are different according to where you are located .  More information and data are available from the UKCP09 website.</p>

UK Climate Projections 2009, Crown copyright.UKCP09 data show 50th, 90th and 10th percentile estimates for each climate metric for the low (L50), medium (M50) and high (H50) emissions scenarios. Population-weighted centre-points of neighbourhoods (MSOAs) areas have been used to allocate neighbourhood-based data to the appropriate 25km grid cell. See the main report for more information.</p>
