        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> Higher proportions of people on low incomes in an area indicate a higher vulnerability. Low income households are more vulnerable to flooding due to the effect of low income on people’s ability to adapt (to prepare for events, respond to them when they occur and recover from them afterwards).</p></td>

        <td valign="top" width="75%"><p> More information about people on low incomes and social vulnerability, as well as what can be done to help, is available in the main site. <a href="http://www.climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-low-incomes" target="_blank">http://www.climatejust.org.uk/messages/people-low-incomes</a></p>
            <p>Some of the specific evidence for this indicator includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low income households are less likely to have the capacity to fully prepare for future floods (through insurance and property level measures).</li>
                <li>Low income households are less likely to own their own home. Housing tenure together with low income may restrict people’s ability to make modifications to the home they do not own (Fielding and Burningham, 2005).</li>
                <li>A lack of savings restricts the ability of households to respond immediately to flood damage, e.g. through spending on repairs and replacements that would kick-start a recovery process. (Tapsell et al., 2002)</li>
                <li>Disruption of transport systems by flood events is likely to particularly affect people who depend upon (rather than choose to use) public transport to get to their place of work or to access other services (for example, public transport is typically more used by low income households).</li>
