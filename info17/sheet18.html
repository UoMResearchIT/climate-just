  <h4>Enhanced Exposure (heat)</h4>
  <p>Enhanced exposure refers to aspects of the physical environment, such as the availability of green space or housing characteristics, which tend to accentuate or offset the severity of heat wave or flood events. The map shows the result of an equally-weighted combination of neighbourhood-level scores for indicators within the domains associated with enhanced exposure with respect to heat:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Physical environment</li>
  <li>Physical geography</li>
  <li>Building characteristics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Neighbourhood mapping uses Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) from the UK Census, 2011. More information is available in the ClimateJust user guide  and list of limitations . This area-based representation provides only a broad, national-scale indication of local patterns and users are strongly encouraged to build on this starting point with finer scale geographical data and other local data holdings.</p>
